# Levy C curve
This code was written in the PyCharm IDE using the 'pygame' library

This code generates a Levy Curve fractal from zero to 15 iterations directly in the window and additionally can move and zoom this fractal as you want.

Controls: 

"W" - move the fractal up, 
"S" - move the fractal down, 
"A" - move the fractal to the left, 
"D" - move the fractal to the right

"Arrow up" - increase the number of iterations, 
"Arrow down" - decrease the number of iterations

"Right arrow" - decrease the fractal size, 
"Left arrow" - increase the fractal size
